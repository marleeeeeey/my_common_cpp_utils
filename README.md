`my_cpp_utils` stands for  `MarleeeeeeY Common C++ Utilities`.

Here are some common C++ utilities that I frequently use in my projects. They include functions for working with:
- JSON configuration files,
- useful macros for logging and formatting,
- mathematical functions,
- string manipulation functions.
